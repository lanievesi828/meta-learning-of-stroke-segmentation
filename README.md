This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for our research study: "Task Engineering as a Catalyst for Meta-Learning in Medical Image Segmentation". 

In this work, we systematically investigate the application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for multi-site stroke lesion segmentation. We discover that the success of meta-learning critically hinges on task design. We propose a **Functional Task Engineering (FTE)** paradigm that leverages clinical metadata to construct tasks based on pathological properties (e.g., lesion anatomical location), which significantly boosts MAML's few-shot adaptation performance.

> **Note:** This research is currently in preparation for submission. A link to the preprint or published paper will be added here upon availability.

## üíæ Dataset and Preprocessing

### Dataset

This study is based on the publicly available **ATLAS v2.0 dataset**. You can request access from their official website: https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/atlas.html.

### Preprocessing

Due to the dataset's size and licensing, we cannot provide the data directly. However, we provide the full preprocessing scripts to generate the required datasets from the raw NIfTI files.

1.  **Download and organize the raw data

2.  **Run the Functional Task Preprocessing:**
    - Open `src/preprocessing_v4_functional.py`.
    - Modify the `data_folder`, `metadata_file`, and `output_base_folder` paths in the `CONFIG` dictionary.
    - Run the script:
      ```bash
      python -m src.preprocessing_v4_functional
      ```
    - This will generate the `maml_data_functional_tasks` directory, containing all processed `.npy` slices and the crucial `..._functional_meta_tasks.json` files.

## üöÄ Usage

All training and evaluation scripts are located in the `src/` directory. Before running, please update the paths in `src/config.py` to point to your preprocessed data directories.

### 1. Standard Supervised Learning (SSL)
This script trains the global SSL model on the functional dataset.
```bash
python -m src.baseline_train # Rename this script if needed
```

### 2. End-to-End MAML Training
This script runs E2E-MAML training from random initialization.
```bash
# Ensure PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH in config.py is set to None or an invalid path
python -m src.train_maml
```

### 3. Pretrain-MAML Training
This script runs MAML training starting from the best SSL model.
```bash
# Ensure PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH in config.py points to the best_model.pth from the SSL run
python -m src.train_maml 
```

### 4. SSL+Finetune Evaluation
This diagnostic script evaluates the few-shot performance of the SSL model.
```bash
# Ensure SSL_MODEL_PATH in the script points to the best_model.pth from the SSL run
python -m src.evaluate_ssl_finetune
```

## üìä Results

Our key finding is that Functional Task Engineering significantly improves MAML's performance. The final performance comparison on our internal validation set is as follows:

| Method (Functional Tasks) | Evaluation | Dice Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pretrain-MAML | Few-shot | **0.4390** |
| E2E-MAML | Few-shot | 0.4241 |
| SSL+Finetune | Few-shot | 0.3113 |
| SSL | Global | 0.5273 |

Please see our manuscript for a detailed analysis and discussion of these results.
